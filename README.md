a datapack for moving block entities from one place to another without loosing the items  
to do so, youll need to craft a Pickuping Wrench (crafting: (1st row: air, air, iron_ingot) (2nd row: air, iron_ingot, iron_ingot) (3rd row: iron_ingot, air, air))  
to pickup a block entity you need to leftclick on it with the wrench, and to place it down just right click  

to use the datapack copy the `pickitup_data_pack` folder from `build/` to your world's datapack folder  

!!! IMPORTANT !!!  
THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (`pickitup_resource_pack` in the build directory alongside `pickitup_data_pack`)
